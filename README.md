# Ex3-C

This project has two parts:
The first part is about insertion sort by using arithmetic of pointers, but not spelling arrays[].
The second part is about search in given text. The program receives string and text as input and executes one of the following options:
A. Print all the lines in the text in which the strings appears. 
B. Print all the words in the text that resemble a string to the point of omitting one letter from the word.
